## 1. Getting Started

### Access Cursor:

* Download and install Cursor from [cursor.so](https://www.cursor.so)
* Open your project folder or create a new one
* Sign in for full AI features (GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude, etc.)

### Understand Cursor Modes:

* **Inline Completion:** Get code suggestions as you type.
* **Chat Panel:** Ask questions, request code, or debug in natural language.
* **Command Palette:** Use `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) for quick actions.
* **File/Codebase Search:** Use AI to find, explain, or refactor code across your project.

## 2. Core Principles of Prompting in Cursor

### Think Like a Collaborator, Not Just a Coder

The more context and direction you provide, the more precise and helpful Cursor becomes. Cursor can reference your entire codebase, so leverage that power!

### 3 Prompting Styles:

1. **Conversational:** "Why is this function slow?"
2. **Instructional:** "Refactor this class to use dependency injection."
3. **Template-Based:** "Act as a senior React developer. Review this component for accessibility."

### Examples:

* "Explain what this file does, step by step."
* "Generate unit tests for this function."
* "Find all usages of `getUser` in the codebase."

## 3. Prompt Structure and Context Windows

### Key Elements of a Strong Prompt

* **Role:** "Act as a security auditor."
* **Goal:** "Help me find vulnerabilities in this API."
* **Constraints:** "Only suggest changes that don't break existing tests."
* **Examples:** "Here's a sample output I want to match."

### Prompt Blueprint:

```
Act as a [role]. I need help with [task].
Here is some context: [paste code or describe file].
Please output it in [format]. Keep the tone [tone].
Use this as a reference: [example].
```

### Add Iteration:

* "List 3 refactoring options."
* "Explain your reasoning."
* "Ask questions if anything is unclear."

---

## 4. Roleplay & Simulation Use Cases

Cursor can simulate:

* Code reviews ("Act as a senior backend engineer")
* Pair programming sessions
* Security audits
* User testing (simulate user flows)
* System design interviews

Use roles and context for best results.

---

## 5. Research, Summarization, and Learning in Codebases

Cursor excels at:

* Summarizing large files or entire codebases
* Explaining legacy code or unfamiliar libraries
* Generating documentation or README files
* Creating diagrams or architecture overviews

### Advanced Research Techniques:

* "Summarize this file in 1 paragraph and bullet points."
* "Explain how data flows from the frontend to the database in this project."
* "List all environment variables used in this repo."

---

## 6. Creative Coding Workflows

Cursor can:

* Brainstorm architecture or design patterns
* Generate boilerplate for new features
* Suggest alternative implementations
* Write code in different styles or languages
* Create visualizations or diagrams (using markdown or code)

### Creative Prompt Tips:

* Specify language, framework, and style ("Write a REST API in FastAPI, following clean architecture principles.")

---

## 7. Technical and Developer Power Features

For developers, Cursor can:

* Refactor code across multiple files
* Generate, explain, or optimize algorithms
* Write and run tests
* Debug error messages and suggest fixes
* Help with SQL queries, shell scripts, Dockerfiles, and CI/CD configs

### Advanced Usage:

* "Find all places where this deprecated function is used and suggest replacements."
* "Explain the time and space complexity of this algorithm."
* "Generate a migration script for this schema change."

---

## 8. Formatting, Memory, and Limitations

### Formatting Tips:

* Ask for **tables**, **JSON**, **markdown**, **code blocks**, or **diffs**
* Use triple backticks for code clarity

### Memory:

* Cursor can reference your open files and project context, but does not have persistent memory across sessions (unless you use comments or documentation).
* Use comments in code to provide context for future AI interactions.

### Limitations:

* No real-time internet access (unless using web search plugins)
* May "hallucinate" or make incorrect suggestions—always review code
* Not a replacement for code review or security audits

## 9. Pro Tips and Advanced Features

* **Multi-file Edits:** Ask Cursor to refactor or update code across several files at once.
* **Semantic Search:** Use AI-powered search to find code by meaning, not just text.
* **Command Palette:** Use for quick actions, refactoring, or running scripts.
* **Custom Prompts:** Save and reuse your favorite prompts for repetitive tasks.
* **Plugin Integrations:** Connect with external tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, web search, test runners).

## 10. Example Prompt Walkthroughs

**Goal:** Refactor a legacy authentication system

**Prompt:**

```
Act as a senior backend engineer. Here is the current authentication code:
[Paste Code]
Refactor it to use JWT tokens and explain the changes.
```

**Goal:** Debug a failing test

**Prompt:**

```
Act as a Python test expert. Here is the test output:
[Paste Error]
What is causing the failure, and how can I fix it?
```

**Goal:** Generate documentation

**Prompt:**

```
Summarize this file and generate a markdown docstring for each function.
[Paste Code]
```

## Final Thoughts

Cursor is a powerful AI partner for developers. The more context, clarity, and direction you provide, the more valuable its output. Treat it as a collaborative teammate—ask, iterate, and refine your prompts for best results.

**The real secret?**  
Use Cursor not just as a code generator, but as a thinking, reviewing, and learning partner embedded in your workflow.
